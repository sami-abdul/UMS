# UMS
University Management System
# Objective
made for educational establishments to help administration to manage the mass data of students, teachers and deans. This System  provides capabilities for manipulating and managing large data being generated on regular bases. Moreover, the System can be used by students to manage their activities, keep track of their performance, select courses for next semester. The System can be used by university teachers to keep track of their studentâ€™s attendance, etc. Deans of the departments too can manage and generate attendance reports of students and employees and salary report of employees working at the department. The System also provides the ability to chat in real-time. The objective of the System is to automate everything that goes on in the university with just one click. The students will be able to do tasks that would otherwise require wasting time in long lines.
